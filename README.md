# Nanometer CMOS Technologies - Exercises from Course (PSP)

This repository contains materials and results from the "Nanometer CMOS Technologies" course I am taking as part of my studies. The course focuses on studying and applying CMOS technologies at nanometer process nodes.

The exercises include designing and analyzing transistors in CMOS technology at the nanometer scale, examining performance parameters, power consumption, and conducting simulations using PSP (Process Simulation Platform) technology.

This repository contains scripts, documentation, simulation results, and various analyses that help to explore the production and optimization of electronic circuits using the latest technologies.

Simulations are being performed using the nqSpice environment.

### because of my lazyness, often different simulaions were performed on the same file, to see what was done, look at commits histor
